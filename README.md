Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or your preferred package manager)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

### 4. Run the Development Servers

WanderWise requires two development processes to run simultaneously: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

- **Start the Next.js app:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  Your application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

- **Start the Genkit development UI (in a separate terminal):**
  ```bash
  npm run genkit:dev
  ```
  This allows you to inspect and debug your AI flows at `http://localhost:4000`.
